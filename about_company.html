Iâ€™m interested in software development, particularly in Java and Spring frameworks. I love exploring new technologies and staying updated with the latest trends in the tech industry. Iâ€™m currently learning advanced concepts in Spring Boot, including JPA, Hibernate, and building RESTful web services. I'm also enhancing my skills in frontend technologies like Angular and React. Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, especially those related to full-stack development. I'm eager to contribute to projects that have a meaningful impact and help me grow as a developer. How to reach me: You can reach me via email at sudhirkumar181297@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn. Pronouns: He/Him âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, I enjoy hiking and exploring new places. I also have a passion for cooking and love experimenting with different cuisines.
